Allows the user to add products to its cart.

When a product is added to the user cart & the product was already in the cart, the quantity is **replaced** by the new one.

As an example, if I had a cart with 4 "Blue Jacket", then I add again 2 "Blue Jacket", my cart will contain **2** "Blue Jacket".
